# 1. Write a Python program that starts with two dictionaries
# and creates a new dictionary containing only the key-value
# pairs that are common to both dictionaries.

# Tips: Generate starting dictionaries by yourself.


# 2. Write a Python program that starts with a list of dictionaries
# and returns a new list containing only the dictionaries where
# the "country" key is "USA" and the "population" key is greater than 1000000.

# Tips: Generate some random data in disc format -
[
    {'country': 'some country name', 'population': 'some population value'},
    {'country': 'some country name', 'population': 'some population value'}
]


# 3. Write a Python program that takes a dictionary as input and
# returns a new dictionary where the keys and values are swapped.

# Tips: Generate starting dictionaries by yourself.


# 4. Write a Python program that takes a list of dictionaries and
# returns a new list containing only the dictionaries where the
# "name" key starts with the letter "J".

# Tips: Create your own starting list with dictionaries that
# will be used in this example.

# 5. Write a Python program that takes two dictionaries
# and merges them into a single dictionary.

# 6. Write a Python program that takes a list of dictionaries
# and returns a new list containing only the dictionaries where
# the "age" key is greater than or equal to 18.

# Tips: Generate your own list with dictionaries that
# will be used in this example.

# 7. Write a Python program that counts the frequency of
# each word in a string using a dictionary.

# Tips: Generate starting string/sentence by yourself.


# 8. Write a Python function that takes a dictionary as
# input and returns the keys in alphabetical order.

# Tips: Google solution for this example. We haven't covered
# all elements that will be needed for solution.

# 9. Write a Python program that starts with a dictionary and
# returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs
# where the value is an even number.

# Tips: Generate starting dictionary by yourself.

# 10. Write a Python program that starts with list of dictionaries
# and a KEY and returns a new list containing only the
# dictionaries where the specified KEY is present.

# Tips: Generate starting list with dictionaries and KEY by
# yourself.

# 11. Write a Python program that takes a dictionary and
# returns the sum of all the values in the dictionary.

# 12. Write a Python program that takes a dictionary
# and returns the key that has the highest value.

# 13. Write a Python program that takes a dictionary
# and a list of keys as input and returns a new dictionary
# containing only the key-value pairs where the key is in
# the specified list.

# Tips: Generate data that should be used in this example.

# 14. Write a Python program that takes a list of dictionaries
# and returns a new list containing only the dictionaries where
# the "name" key is present and the "age" key is less than 30.

# Tips: Generate data that should be used in this example.

# 15. Write a Python function that takes a dictionary and a
# value as input and returns a list of keys that have that value.

# Tips: Generate data that should be used in this example.

# 16. Think about 'Life pattern in programming' (I believe I named
# it that way during last lesson). Explain that using your words.
# Create example that shows implementation of that pattern.
