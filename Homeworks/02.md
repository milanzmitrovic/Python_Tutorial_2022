# Homeworks:

# *** When working with integers in homework,
#     always choose integers greater than 300.

# 1. Create 10 variables that are going to hold integer objects.
# 2. Create 10 variables that will store float objects.
# 3. Create 10 variables that store string objects.
# 4. Create 20 variables that store any data type (inf, float, str), but
# use not valid Python variable name. Here we expect to receive Python errors.

# 5. Create 2 variables that are storing two different references to integer 
# objects. Check if two objects have same value.

# 6. Create 2 variables that are storing reference to same integer object. 
# Confirm that both variables are pointing to same object.
# Confirm that 'both' objects have same value.

# 7. Create arbitrary string of at least 20 characters. 
# Name it as 'my_string_variable'.

# 8. Check length of my_string_variable.
# Print length of my_string_variable.

# 9. Print ID of my_string_variable.

# 10. Create new variable named my_string_variable_2 that
# are going to store reference to same object as my_string_variable.

# 11. Check if data to which our variables are pointing (my_string_variable and my_string_variable_2),
# are equal.

# 12. Check if our objects ((my_string_variable and my_string_variable_2) 
# are pointing to same object/data.

# 13. Create new string. Name it my_favourite_string.
# Check ID of that string.

# 14. Create new string my_favourite_string_2. 
# Variable my_favourite_string_2 should point to different
# object/data, but it should have same value as my_favourite_string.


# 15. Prove that you correctly created solution to exercise 14.

# 16. Take first 5 characters form string whose reference/ID is 
# stored in my_string_variable.

# 17. Take last 10 characters from string whose reference/ID is 
# # stored in my_string_variable.

# This task can also be written:
#   Take last 10 characters from variable my_string_variable.
#   Or, take last 10 characters from string stored in my_string_variable.

# 18. Take everything from my_string_variable, but not first 3 characters.

# 19. Take everything, but bot last 3 characters from my_string_variable.

# 20. Take characters from position 5 (including 5th character) up to 
# (and including) character 17.

# 21. Take string characters from position 15 (including 15th character) and
# up to position 10 (including 10th character).
# Tip: you should do inverse slicing sth like [-6: -4]


# 22. Reverse string stored in my_string_variable.
