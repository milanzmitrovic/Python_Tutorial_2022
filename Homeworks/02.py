# 1. Create list with numbers from 0 to 20.
#    Name list as list_1.

# 2. Create list with numbers from 20 to 0.
#    Name list as list_2.

# 3. Add previously created two lists.

# 4. Multiply list_1 6 times.
#    What you got?

# 5. Subtract 5 from each element in list_2.
#    Create list_3 that will hold results.

# 6. Create alias i.e. assign nickname to list_1.
#    New nickname should be list_alias_1.
#    Prove that you did exercise correctly.

# 7. Create list that have same elements as list_2,
#    but it should have different ID.
#    Prove that you did exercise correctly.

# 8. Create list_a that has values from 200 to 300.
#    Create list_b that has values from 500 to 400.
#    Create list_c in following fashion:\
#       list_a = [1,2,3]
#       list_b = [4,5,6]
#       list_c = [5,7,9]

# 9. Create list_1 with numbers from 100 to 400.
#    Create list_2 that will have structure like:
#    list_1 = [1,2,3,4]
#    list_2 = [1,2,9,16]

# 10. Create list that will have 30 elements.
#     Each element should be random number between 0 and 77.

# 11. Create list with arbitrary data types (str, int, float,...)

# 12. Create nested list i.e. list with lists inside.

# 13. Create list_1 with arbitrary strings inside it.
#     Append new string elements to list_1.
#     Check if ID of list_1 has been changed?

# 14. Remove first and last element in list_1 from
#     previous exercise.
#     Check if ID of list_1 has been changed?

# 15. Create my_list with numbers from 100 to 200.
#     Loop through list and print each element
#     multiplied by 3.

# 16. Research about 'if statements' in Python.
#     Loop through my_list from previous exercise,
#     even elements put in even_list and odd elements
#     put in odd_list.

# 17. Create some example with 'copy' function.
#     Show if ID is being changed after modifying
#     elements of list.

# 18. Create some arbitrary list. 
#     Delete all elements from list.
#     CHeck if ID of list has been changed?


# 19. Create some arbitrary list.
#     Delete first and last element of list.
#     Check if ID of list was changed?

# 20. Try to find some method of list
#     class that we haven't been using.
#     Show some example with that method.
