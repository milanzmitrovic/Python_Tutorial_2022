# Create FastApi backend service with following features:
#   - There is Pydantic BaseModel that helps us keep
#     track of student_id (int), student_age (int), student_name (str),
#     student_average_grade (float), student_year_of_study (int).

#   - Create route that will have path named 'create_new_student'. It will
#     append student data into txt/csv file named student_database.csv or
#     student_database.txt . Choose format that you like.

#   - Create route with path named 'read_one_student'. It will accept student_id
#     and return student with that specific id.

#   - Create route with path named 'update_student'. It will accept all data
#     about student and update it in student_database file.
#   - If student_id is not already present in database, returns error saying
#     that you can update student that is not already written to database.

#   - Create route with path named 'delete_student'. It will accept student_id and
#     perform deletion of respective student from student_database file.
#   - If student does not exist, return error saying that you can not delete
#     student that does not exist in database.

#   - Create route named 'get_all_students'. It will return list with all student
#     from database.

#   - Create route with name 'get_students_by_age'. It accept student age as
#     input parameter (argument) and return all students with specific age.
